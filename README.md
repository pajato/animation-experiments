# Recreating Bose Connect Music Player

This project, **animation-experiments** is an attempt to recreate the Bose Connect app's music player using Kotlin and 
the [Umano Sliding Up Panel](https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel), most notable for being present in Google 
Play Music and Google Maps. The project is not hooked up to any audio player or back end, focusing entirely on creating
a smooth and robust user experience. The priority of the project was to learn how to animate using ConstraintLayout,
ConstraintSet, and animating a TextView's text size in a smooth way. The majority of the animation code is in the 
[AnimationHelper](../master/app/src/main/java/com/pajato/drawerreplacement/AnimationHelper.kt) class.
